# Week 1.5 - Explore Unity
Going to be honest, this was a stressful week! A lot going on with other courses and life(tm) made it difficult to get any work done. I have nothing to show for today * but * hopefully this evening or tomorrow a Week 2 post will appear of me actually doing this week's assignment. I should note that I do take a bit of accountability for pushing this week's work off til the last minute, one of these days I'll fix that...

# Week 1 - Make A Thing
I was surprised at how much using Bitsy was an exercise in frustration. While the focus of the platform is on how restricted your toolset is, the lack of quality of life features felt like an oversight rather than an intentional decision. Having no option to rotate tiles meant that what could have been a quick one and done process became a task I had to repeat four times, which also took away from productivity as I had to sort through three duplicate tiles in my tileset.

 *Two of the same tiles "rotated" are really just two seperately drawn tiles*

In addition, the platform was significantly glitchier than I had expected. Tiles would randomly swap with each other, the game would occasionally appear to have reverted to the default template, and more. This became a struggle against the system, instead of with it.

*The tiles were not updating, giving the appearance that nothing changed. On reload, the random clicks I had made suddenly displayed*

My procrastination meant that I had put off the project until the last minute, so I had to make something quick and scrappy. I wished I had a bit more “gameplay” instead of walking around and clicking on sprites but even still, there were some keen observations I had noticed through playtesting. The first is that while I had thought it would be best to make the avatar and background sprites the same colour for consistency, it was surprisingly hard to tell the two apart. In addition, I should have been more careful with the tile size limits. Representing a beach with a volleyball court could be done, but I was a little too sloppy with the pixel art and as a result players had a hard time telling what was what. In addition, there was the expectation that players could enter said volleyball court, which I intentionally made not the case. In the future I should do a better job communicating what is interactable and what is not.

*This volleyball court isn't actually explorable*
