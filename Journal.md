Tetris Effect is one of my favourite games, period. When it was originally a Playstation 4 exclusive, it was what pushed me over to get that console. But it's just tetris at the end of the day, right? What sets Tetris Effect apart from the myriad versions of the game that have existed for decades? There are two main innovations that the game makes (specifically in the single-player "Journey Mode"): the reactive visuals/audio as well as the Zone mechanic.

While previous editions of Tetris have provided some level of feedback on player actions such as clearing lines or performing certain advanced techniques, there has not been a game that responds in the same way as Tetris Effect. In this game, clearing a line could result in a flame errupting from the bottom of the screen, blocks fluttering, or the scene entirely shifting. There is never a moment where clearing a line does not create a visual flourish. The entire game is about surrendering yourself to the atmosphere, and thanks to these visual reflections rather than explicit callouts (e.g in Puyo Puyo Tetris, the characters yell out "Tetris" when performing a Tetris), the player forms a deep connection with the game world. Since there are fixed amount of lines you have to clear in any given level, these responses also serve as a subtle progress indicator. While there is a count of your progress on the side of the screen, the player does not have to rely on it. In any given level, the scene (usually) changes three times, meaning whenever a player causes the scene to change, they have progressed a third through the level. This implicit understanding from the player rather than explicit telling from the game is another tactic they use to surrender the player to the game world. Finally, the use of sound/visuals reacting in real time to player inputs allows them to gain a tangible feel over the world, putting effort into the game and receving immediate feedback, further blurring the lines of  player/game relationship.

Next is the Zone mechanic. In any given point of the game, clearling lines results in a "Zone" meter filling up over time. By pressing on any trigger button, you can activate the "Zone", slowing time down and allowing you to focus on your block placement. In the zone, every line cleared moves to the bottom of the screen, only truly being cleared once the meter runs out, allowing you to clear more than four lines at once, a usually impossible move. This Zone meter is a perfect implementation of getting a player into a flow state. Several academic expressions of the flow state are made literal, such as the sense of time being altered, immediate feedback being provided (a counter appears at the bottom of the screen when clearing lines), as well as a lack of pressure in the moment (since time is slowed). The zone meter is also an easy way for players to determine their own difficulty. You can use it as a simple "get out of jail free" card, or let the screen purposely fill up before activating the zone, betting on being able to clear the mess you made, hopefully resulting in a big payout of points.

What I love about Tetris Effect is how much effort the developers have put into getting the player to fall into a trance, dealing with incresingly hard levels of Tetris while not necessarily feeling the stress too much. If I were to apply these lessons to my own game, it would be to provide subtle feedback to the player, getting them invested in the game world while not reminding them that they are actively playing a game on a computer screen. It may be beyond the scope of this class, but the idea of having a player set their own challenge is an intriguing idea that I would like to explore in my own time. Finally, I would like to simply explore reactive audio/visual systems in games. Tetsuya Miziguchi's projects including Tetris Effect have (mostly) all involved some aspect of audio/visual reactivity, and they are some of my favourite game experiences I have had.
